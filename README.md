# ðŸ§  HSC Maths Classifier (LangChain + GPT-4o + Vision)

This project allows you to upload a PDF of an HSC Mathematics exam paper, extract each question as an **image**, and automatically classify it into the correct topic(s) using GPT-4o Vision. Users can also correct the classifications and feed them back into the system to improve future predictions.

## ðŸš€ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/freeAntiVirus/Langchain-app.git
cd langchain-app
```

---

### 2. Set Up the Backend (FastAPI + LangChain)

#### a. Navigate to backend folder
```bash
cd backend
```

#### b. Install dependencies
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

#### c. Create a `.env` file
Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory:

```bash
touch .env
```

Paste your OpenAI API key inside it:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

#### d. Start the backend server
```bash
python3 -m uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### 3. Set Up the Frontend (React)

#### a. Navigate to frontend folder
```bash
cd ../hsc-ui
```

#### b. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

#### c. Start the development server
```bash
